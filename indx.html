    <p class="text-muted text-left text-capitalize" >1. Since 1905, Singapore has changed its time zones 6 times! Presently its time zone is GMT+8 (just to be in synch with Malaysia), but it is technically still incorrect. Singapore should be in the GMT +7.5 time zone. 2. Chewing gum is banned in Singapore. Only those with medical prescription can chew gum! 3. Singapore is one of the 20 smallest countries in the world. The main island is 42 kilometres long and 23 kilometres wide and has a total land area of just 683 square kilometres. 4. There is a maximum limit to how high buildings in Singapore can be built, which is 280 meters. 5. The Tanjong Pagar Centre, opened in 2016, is Singapore’s tallest building at 290 meters. Special permission was granted to it to exceed the usual height restriction of 280 meters.
6. Sang Nila Utama, a Palembang prince, saw what he thought was a lion on the island; and thus he christened it as Singapura, which translates to 'lion city' in Sanskrit. However, there were no lions in Singapore at that time. Lions were only brought in modern times for the zoos! 7. Other than the four official languages: English, Chinese, Malay, and Tamil that Singaporeans speak, they also speak a fifth language which is a local lingo by the name of Singlish. However, instead of being a broken language, it is a really complicated creole that foreigners cannot pick up easily. 8. A total of 27 Singlish words have made it to the Oxford dictionary. 9. In all of Southeast Asia, you will find the largest size of Yakult bottles in Singapore.
10. Collectively, Singaporeans are the fastest pedestrians in the world, walking at a speed of about 6.15 kilometres per hour! 11. Of the only five official Tintin shops in the world, one of them is in Chinatown in Singapore (the remaining four are in Japan and Europe). 12. With over 260 food stalls, the Complex Food Centre in Chinatown is the largest hawker centre in all of Singapore. 13. After New Zealand, Singapore is the easiest place across the globe to do business, according to a business list published by the World Bank. 14. You can find the National Anthem of Singapore on the back of the SGD 1000 note, written in micro text.
The tallest indoor waterfall in the world is located in Singapore at the Gardens by the Bay, and it stands at a height of 35 meters.
. The Changi Airport was voted as the World’s Best Airport for the fourth time in a row in the year 2016.
In 2008, when the Singapore Flyer opened, it rotated in a counter-clockwise direction when viewed from the Marina Centre. Later that year, it was reversed, on the advice of the Feng Shui masters. </p>

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, so it is hugely encouraging to see so many vaccines proving and going into development. WHO is working tirelessly with partners to develop, manufacture and deploy safe and effective vaccines. Safe and effective vaccines are a game-changing tool: but for the foreseeable future we must continue wearing masks, cleaning our hands, ensuring good ventilation indoors, physically distancing and avoiding crowds. Being vaccinated does not mean that we can throw caution to the wind and put ourselves and others at risk, particularly because research is still ongoing into how much vaccines protect not only against disease but also against infection and transmission. See WHO’s landscape of COVID-19 vaccine candidates for the latest information on vaccines in clinical and pre-clinical development, generally updated twice a week. WHO’s COVID-19 dashboard, updated daily, also features the number of vaccine doses administered globally with more detail provided on the dedicated COVID-19 vaccination dashboard. At a regional level, there is an AFRO COVID-19 vaccines dashboard and a PAHO COVID-19 vaccines deliveries dashboard. But it’s not vaccines that will stop the pandemic, it’s vaccination. We must ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines, and ensure every country receives them and can roll them out to protect their people, starting with the most vulnerable.

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Many people are experiencing grief during the COVID-19 pandemic. Grief is a normal response to loss during or after a disaster or other traumatic event. Grief can happen in response to loss of life, as well as to drastic changes to daily routines and ways of life that usually bring us comfort and a feeling of stability. Common grief reactions include: Shock, disbelief, or denial Anxiety Distress Anger Periods of sadness Loss of sleep and loss of appetite Some people may experience multiple losses during a disaster or large-scale emergency event. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, you might be unable to be with a loved one when they die, or unable to mourn someone’s death in-person with friends and family. Other types of loss include unemployment, or not making enough money, loss or reduction in support services, and other changes in your lifestyle. These losses can happen at the same time, which can complicate or prolong grief and delay a person’s ability to adapt, heal, and recover
